# Renting: Six out of 10 renters live in energy-inefficient homes

![Map showing average home heat loss in different European countries: UK homes lose 3 degrees after five hours, higher than any other European country](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CBB3/production/_129274125_home_temperature_loss_map_v3_640-nc.png.webp)

In April 2022, the BBC Shared Data unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65136313) that six out of 10 recently inspected UK rental homes failed to meet a proposed new standard for energy efficiency.

## Background and briefing

A [full briefing pack on the story can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bqbvfRrsB4Wl65fzJNGQnNTf-jsUH_qthGZ1cUCPSw/edit#heading=h.eksa1piu3vo).

* Scotland: [Domestic Energy Performance Certificates](https://statistics.gov.scot/data/domestic-energy-performance-certificates)
* Northern Ireland: [EPC data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1agvRoD5CbjKUpSm_XiyI81OC65o8S71OFJzeYMoNqM0/edit#gid=0) ([XLSX](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/energy-efficiency-private-rental/blob/main/data/Northern%20Ireland%20EPC%20data.xlsx)) via [a Freedom of Information request](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/energy-efficiency-private-rental/blob/main/data/Northern%20Ireland%20FOI%20response.pdf).

Data on energy performance certificates (EPCs) is provided in a series of separate CSV files which was combined for analysis. For the England and Wales data, this was done [using an R script](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/energy-efficiency-private-rental/blob/main/scripts/energyeff01compile.md). For the Scotland data this was done using `cat` in command line. 

The resulting files were too large for data analysis in spreadsheets, R or Python, so they were uploaded to Google BigQuery for initial analysis and filtering [using SQL queries documented here](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/energy-efficiency-private-rental/blob/main/scripts/Energy%20efficiency%20(private%20rental)_%20BigQuery%20SQL%20queries.pdf).

The results of that initial analysis were further analysed using R notebooks in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/energy-efficiency-private-rental/tree/main/scripts).
